High-level overview of changes to Perspectives

Format:
+ new feature
* bug or behavior fix
X Loss of functionality

We attempt to use meaningful version numbers, following semver.org:
	Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
	MAJOR version when you make large architectural changes,
	MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
	PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.


4.6
---
+ Add option to contact notaries when in private browsing (off by default)
+ Expose timeout duration and number of query retries as a user preference
+ Expose maximum caching duration as a user preference
+ Improve whitelist interface:
	* Convert whitelist textfield into a table with columns
	+ Domain column is sortable
	+ Regexes can be clicked and edited
	+ Whitelist entries can be clicked to activate or deactivate
	+ Table supports multi row selection and removal
	+ Added localizations (en, de) for columns and remove button
+ Add functionality to quickly and easily distrust all built-in certificates
* Highly visible notifications when certificates fail (multiple certificates, one not recently seen; multiple certificates)
* Extract remaining hardcoded strings for localization
* Some German (de) localization fixes
* Convert some alerts to Perspectives wrapped alerts
* Prevent the addition of duplicate notaries
* Correctly detected and set status for "quorum not reached" in non-english languages.
* Temporarily remove all 'Report Attack' functionality, until the feature is fixed
* Check if result signature and timestamps are correct when processing notary results, and visually mark as red if either is incorrect
* Warn on mismatching notary public keys
+ Remove red from color result keys, as it's now used for "invalid signature"
+ Display required quorum duration in notary results
* Rescue the svg/image test page
+ Convert README to markdown file
+ Add more info in README on how to debug and test
+ Draw stale-limit line across notary results
* Remove use of base64.js; entirely replaced by internal browser functions
+ Visually indicate cached results in the resultst dialog
+ Visually indicate whitelisted entries with a different icon
* Clean up unit tests so many tests are more clear, better organized, and/or easier to maintain
* Refactor test file so more tests can be run without installing the extension (i.e. separate chrome-dependent functionality from non-chrome-dependent functionality)
* Many areas of code cleanup (add hasOwnProperty checks; fix === checks)


4.5.2
-----
* Add SparkMD5 library as external library to provide MD5 hashing functionality (has been removed in Firefox 32)


4.5.1
-----
* Add (pl) Polish translation! Many thanks to Jakub and Sonia!
* Fix typos and whitespace in localization files


4.5
---
+ Enable https queries to notaries! For now, turn this on by adding 'https://' in front of the notary URL
* Fix unit tests to use === instead of ==
* Fix return value for get_quorum_duration(). Fixing the tests in the previous item exposed this bug.
* Fix use of quorum_size for key_weakly_seen_by_quorum(). It's actually used now. (GH 89)
* Fix the tooltip used by Perspectives icon during location changes (GH 112)
* Fix icon status for location change events - only set the icon spinning for https sites (GH  113)


4.4.2
-----
* Update German translation


4.4.1
-----
* Rescue localization tests! Tests now run as a python script at build-time (GH 74)
* Fix call to XMLHttpRequest constructor to use 'new' - compatability fix for the upcoming Firefox 30 (GH 108)
* Update German translations (thanks Patrick!)
* Unlock Dutch and Finnish translations (thanks Alf and Ville!). These translations are not fully complete, but enabling them at least lets people see *some* text in their desired language.
* Remove perspectives1.networknotary.org from the set of default notaries. This notary needs to be upgraded before it can be used full-time.


4.4
---
+ Add new preference to show/hide the notification box when "Ask before contacting notaries" is enabled (GH 101)
* Fix the 'Learn More' button (thanks to Jens for the bug report!) (GH 100)

4.3.8
-----
* Fix bug with incorrect public/private address resolution (GH 94)


4.3.7
-----
* Fix text display for weakly seen results (tooltip was not getting set, causing the UI to show 'null' in the results window)
* Add sanity checks for invalid time ranges when calculating weakly seen property
* Add unit tests for weakly seen keys, keys with short durations, keys with gaps, and calculation of key duration
* Fix minor debug function calls
* Improve documentation on how to release updates (update_howto.txt)


4.3.6
-----
* Security Fix: incorrect quorum duration with low number of notaries or quorum percentage (GH 87)
* Refactor unit tests: unit test js file is now optionally installed with the rest of the extension (this makes it run properly under newer versions of Firefox) (GH 74)
* Remove several global variables; convert to local with 'var'
* Add new whitelist icon (image file added, but code not hooked up yet)
* Minor improvements to the makefile formatting and output
X Localization tests temporarily removed so we can ship to patch the security bug. They still need to be transcribed/relocated to a non-javascript language to run at build time. (fixed in 4.4.1)


4.3.5
-----
* Fix code for retrieving private browsing data (used for untrusted certs in Firefox v22 and up)

4.3.4
-----
* Update code for retrieving invalid certificate info for Firefox v20 (GH 77)
* When sending requeries, only send to notaries that haven't yet replied.
* Remove unused localization string
* UI improvements:
	* Make the Preferences and Report Attack windows resizable
	* In the Preferences window, set proper default height and width for Notary Server textboxes
	* In the Results window, expand the results textbox vertically to fill available space (This makes more text visible and keeps the radio buttons in a consistent place)

-----
+ Add heimdal and nine-eyes notaries to the default notary list, to improve response rate


4.3.2
-----
* extract hardcoded strings and move to localization files
